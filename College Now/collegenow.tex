\begin{mla}{Lee}{Mracek}{Emmert}{College Now}{\today}{<TITLE>}
    I hate high school. Meaningless work, rigid schedules, early mornings, and
    constant social drama made up my first two years of ``the best four years of
    your life.'' Junior year, I transferred to Middle College at De Anza which
    certainly changed my life for the better. Without the classes that high
    school required me to take, I could build my schedule around my own
    interests, passions, and desire for waking up after the sun. My happiest
    moment in recent months occurred while walking to Coffee Society at dusk
    after my last De Anza class. I embrace the feeling of independence and
    solitude that I was unable to throughly enjoy at any point in my high school experience. Furthermore, my De Anza classes challenge me on a level that I did not experience in my high school classes. At Middle College, I am unable to take all the classes I want to because of the time commitment a two or three hour class in the middle of the day creates. College Now offers the only complete educational package in FUHSD with regards to my interest through challenging De Anza classes, the promise of independence, and the freedom to choose my own schedule. \\
    I have a strong commitment to learning, and prefer the route which allows me to learn the most. I take hard classes not to have them stand out on my college applications, but because I enjoy the learning process that they offer. Neither the high school curriculum and style, nor the Middle College option canot provide the level of depth and breadth that makes up my ideal educational experience. However, through College Now, I will be able to enroll in significantly more De Anza classes than I can in Middle College, and be able to replace the California-mandated government class with something that interests me on a higher level, such as international relations, or political science. \\
    When I am allowed or encouraged to act independently, and able to enjoy the solitude and freedom that comes with it, I enjoy myself more and am encouraged to continue to attempt to develop myself as a person and individual in my community. I cannot wait to pay taxes, shop for groceries, and pay of mortgages because that elicits the feeling of responsibility and independence that I enjoy. As a College Now student, I would be able to become truly a part of the De Anza community, and participate in the myriad events which occur at De Anza between the hours of twelve and three o'clock, such the Table Tennis Club, which meets while I am in Middle College. \\
    While my time in high school has been enormously improved by my time spent in the Middle College program, its limitations prevent me from exploring the full potential of De Anza Community College and deny me from fulfilling my thirst for independence and education. College Now, because of my unique desires, remains the only program that will allow me to completely explore my academic and social potential before I am dumped into the real world.
