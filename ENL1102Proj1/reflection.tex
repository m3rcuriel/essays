  Much like this reflection, my actual essay started with a title. My entire thought process, in fact, sprung from a late night thought about inflationary theory. I was considering how these bubble universes could exist and be subsumed and suddenly realized that that was exactly the feeling ``Deephaven Excursions'' gave. From there, I lept immediately to a thesis statement about the atmosphere of the story, and was able to quickly find several concrete examples including the house and funeral. At the time of the peer-editing session, I had not yet discovered the Sally Chauncey argument. During the workshop my peers gave me the idea to restructure my essay and move the Chauncey paragraph (which I came up with during the workshop) to be the first paragraph instead of the last to add a more cohesive structure. From there I went back over and revised my draft to cover more specific vocabulary used by Jewitt as well as make the argument more cohesive and holistic. I did not utilize an outline for this essay.
