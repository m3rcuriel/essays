<li  class="L1" >War Stories Thesis Outline <ol>
<li  class="L2" >Introduction <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Thesis: Through O'Brian's work, "The Things They Carried," it becomes evident that the only accrate way to capture emotional stories is by sharing what O'Brian likes to call "true war stories." </ol>
<li  class="L2" >"True War Stories" <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Topic: O'Brian, in his own story about true war stories, explains that true war stories are meant to reflect ideas and feelings, and not necessarily the truth. </ol>
<li  class="L2" >Rat Kiley & Emotional Storytelling <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Topic: Rat Kiley, a frequent liar and embellisher, explains to O'Brian that he exaggerates stories in order to convey their emotional truth.
<p  class="P3" >Use the Mary Anne story as evidence, perhaps </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L2" >Curt Lemon and the Moral of the Baby Water Buffalo <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Topic: The baby water buffalo shocks the reader with the raw expression of Rat Kiley's pain but also is the only way to convey that pain in a written medium. </ol>
<li  class="L2" >Conclusion <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Wrap Up: As O'Brian does in <i>The Things They Carried</i>, telling a "true war story" is the only way to accurately convey emotional stories.
<li  class="L3" >Exit: Anyone well versed in storytelling knows that sometimes a little exaggeration will go a long way to conveying the "truth" of a story, whereas the "real" truth may not go as far. In the end, stories are a method of transferring emotion from one to another. People globally devour stories about corruption, robbery, and adventure, because these stories contain that falsehood with a kernel of truth that emotionally carries any story. </ol>
</ol>

<li  class="L2" >Introduction <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Thesis: Because of the necessity of emotional truth in stories, O'Brian in <i>The Things They Carried</i> attempts to prove that stories need not be true if they convey their emotional impact. </ol>
<li  class="L2" >"True War Stories" <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Topic: O'Brian, in his own story about true war stories, explains that true war stories are meant to reflect ideas and feelings, and not necessarily the truth.

<li  class="L2" >The Terror of Mary Anne <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Topic: While Mary Anne's story may not be true, it is the only way to capture the transformation elicited by war.
<p  class="P3" >Include sections of the CTA analysis we did </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L2" >Conclusion <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Wrap Up: Emotional, exaggerated storytelling, as done by O'Brian, is the only way to convey the emotional truth of a story, even if it does not convey the objective truth. </ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L1" >TODO: Norman Bowker isn't real! <ol>
<p  class="P2" >I didn't quite get to this outline. </ol>
