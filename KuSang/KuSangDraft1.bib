    annotation = {Here and Now is a web blog maintained by a man
     by the name of Allen Itz, who seems to be somewhat of a fan of poetry. His
     blog is dominated by large posts with brief analyses of poems that he
     enjoyed, including one by Ku Sang, Springtime Dances. Considering that he
     spends a mere three sentences on his analysis of Ku Sang, Here and Now does
     not seem to be a reputable source as one would hope, but he still offers
     meaningful insights into the deeper meaning of Ku Sang, but does not go far
     enough in depth to be cited much more than once as a source. Also, he does
     not appear to reference any credentials, and while his deep experience with
     poetry may grant him some relevance, his lack of credentials is something
     to be noted while citing his blog.},

     scholars in Korea. This particular article is a full on analysis of the
     meaning of several of Ku Sang's poetry 'cycles,' which follow similar
     themes in order to convey an idea. Consonance of Existence and Eternity
     goes from being a detailed report on Ku Sang's unique poetic style to
     reflecting a higher level view of his thematic elements and interpretation
     of humanity, including aspects of his personal beliefs regarding the
     redemption of human society. This magazine article will greatly assist with
     jumping off points in to the analysis of Ku Sang's works.},
